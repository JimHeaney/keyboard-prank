# USB Keyboard Prank

## Overview
This little circuit is a 32u4 (same microcontroller that you'd find in an Arduino Pro Micro), a voltage regulator, and an NRF24L01, all on a tiny board that can be hidden in a rear USB port of a computer. By using the 32u4's built in USB functionality, I can set the board to take over the target's computer and mouse to play pranks on them.

At random intervals, the board will wake up and do something ranging from a slight annoyance (like typing a random character, or moving the mouse an inch to the right), to crazy things, like opening up Chrome and Rickrolling people.

If that's not enough, the NRF24L01 allows me to trigger other events with another copy of the board plugged into my computer!

## Current Release
